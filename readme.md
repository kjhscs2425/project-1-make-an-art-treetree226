# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

It will be a pig. 

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

Pen size. coordinates (x,y). 

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

Eyes, ears, nostrils, legs, circles (the head and body are both going to be made up of circles).

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

Face and body. Both these components will be made up of a circle which is slightly outlined thicker than the details within it, creating a clear distinction between body and face. 

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

I will use loops for making the eyes, ears, nostrils and legs. For example, a pig typically has two eyes. I can use a loop to make two eyes and outside of the loop, can create different coordinates to place them in different places. The loop can make two same-sized body parts. This can be applied for the ears, nostrils, and legs as well.
